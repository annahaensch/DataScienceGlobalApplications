# Data Science for Global Applications

_This course material was originally prepared by [Anna Haensch](https://annahaensch.com/) and [Karin Knudson](https://karinknudson.com/) for Data Science for Global Applications taught at the Fletcher Graduate School of Global Affairs at Tufts University.  We wrote about some of our motivations and methodology for the 2022 SciPy Conference Proceedings in ["Python for Global Applications: teaching scientific Python in context to law and diplomacy students"](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2022/anna_haensch.html)_.
