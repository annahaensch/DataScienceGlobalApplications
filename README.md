## The Policy Project 

A core throughline of this course is the policy project.  There are various checkpoints and benchmarks throughout the semester.  This project culminates with a final policy paper due at the end of the semester, as well as an in-class presentation of key findings and takeaways.  The critical checkpoints through the semester are as follows:
* __Statement of Policy Question__: Students will develop 2-3 possible policy questions to explore throughout the semester.  A brief explanation of each question will be given to give context to non-experts, and students will identify possible types of data that might be useful.  
* __Identification of Datasets of Interest__:  Students will choose one policy question of focus, and indentify 2-3 datasets that will help them answer this question.  Students will identify the steps necessary to acquire these datasets, but not necessarily carry these steps out (yet). 
* __Draft Data Audit__: Students will gain an understanding of the datasets they are using, with the goal of making sure that their data is reusable, and their work is reproducible.  This is also a mechanism for understanding the origins of the data to help uncover bias.  Precise text of the data audit assignment can he found [here](policy_project/data_audit_assignment.md).  
* __Draft Data Visualization__: Students will use the knowledge gained in the data visualization module of the course to create at least one compelling visualization of their data.  Visualizations will be accompanied by ~100 word alt-text.
* __Presentation__: Students will create a concise one-slide presentation highlighting key takeaways from the project and at leat one illustrative data visualization. Students will present this slide in conversation with the class. 
* __Policy Paper__: Students will prepare a policy paper that specifically addresses their policy question.  This paper will include a "Data Overview" section which contains a narrative version of the data audit a "Methodology" section that includes details of models used, a "Results" section that discusses model output and validation, and a "Conclusions" section that frames results in terms of the posed policy question. The rubric for the policy paper and presentation is below.
